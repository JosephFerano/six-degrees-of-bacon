### Graph Algorithms - Six Degress of Bacon

This was the final project for the CCOM 3034 - Data Structures course.

To run, simply execute `./sixdeg`, to build you can use `make`. Initially the program parses the csv files to create efficient O(1) data structures for later retrieval. You will then be prompted to choose one of two modes;

```
Please choose A or B and press <Enter>
  A.) Get Actors with Nth degree of separation
  B.) Get degrees of separation between two actors
```
`sixdeg.cpp` has additional comments.
